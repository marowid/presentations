Mesh Twin Learning is a great way to build an efficient infrastructure for sharing knowledge between many IoT Edges. If we take a look on the AWS example shown below we could imagine a scenario that after certain ammount of iterations we get an "optimal" process shared accross our factories, and after that such solution is just keeping everything in sync untill some next big change in the process is introduced or a new product goes into production.

However you can still be getting constant benefits from MTL if you use micro changes optimization approach which we build into solutions we deploy for our customers from day 1.

The optimization process methodology starts with performing experiments at different design variables (process parameters). The results are gathered in a Pareto efficient frontier with epistemic uncertainty. If this uncertainty is not acceptable, a new set of experiment is selected to increase the information.
