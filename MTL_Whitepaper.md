# Digital Twins, IoT and ML - Introduction to industry 4.0

## What is Industry 4.0

Traditional, linear manufacturing process uses embedded systems to control machines, for instance to manage speed of assembly line, or control CNC machine. Such manufacturing system has limited data concerning raw materials, process parameters and final products. In addition to that, collected data is analyzed periodically, which causes delays in process improvements.
Industry 4.0 is a major transformation of the way production and manufacturing operates. It is the shift from linear process to integration and real-time data access. Cyber-physical systems enable collection, integration and advanced analysis of data from machines and systems and using insights to manage physical processes. Instead of operating reactively, as it has been always done, companies can learn along the way and use insights to adjust processes in real time. Such systems can self-optimize performance and self-adapt to new conditions in near-real time, and run entire production processes. 
Throughout the cycle data and actions flow continuously between physical and digital worlds. This cycle consists of three steps:
•	Physical to digital: Capture information from the physical world and create a digital record 
•	Digital to digital: Use advanced analytics and AI to uncover meaningful insights 
•	Digital to physical: Translate digital-world decisions to action and change in the physical world

. 
In other words, Industry 4.0 is an integration of IoT – key connectivity enabler, IT technologies such as advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and physical technologies, like additive manufacturing, robotics and advanced materials. Such integration enables physical systems to communicate and cooperate both with each other and with human workers and act upon insights derived from data.  Below table presents examples of technologies that are applied at each step of the physical-to-digital-to-physical loop.

## How Industry 4.0 creates value

Thanks to digitization of operations, manufacturing, supply chain, and products companies can combine learnings from humans, machines, analytics, and predictive insights to make better decisions and create additional value. 
McKinsey has identified eight main value drivers that impact a manufacturing company’s performance. McKinsey have found that applying Industry 4.0 leavers on each of these value drivers lead to improvements.

Resources/process – Industry 4.0 mechanisms improve effectiveness of processes. ABB employed computer-based system to control and optimize cement kiln operations. System mimics behavior of ‘ideal’ cement plant operator. System uses actual measures to calculate process parameters required to meet target performance and adjusts process in real-time. Process optimization yields up to 5% improvement in throughput. 
Asset utilization – leavers like predictive maintenance can provide value by decreasing machine downtime or changeover times. GE10 offers predictive maintenance, where IoT sensors collect and report data on the machinery condition. Advanced analytics use this data to detect early signs of problems and indicate machines requiring maintenance. Predictive maintenance can reduce machines downtime by 30-50 percent and improve their life by 20 to 40 percent. 
Improving labor productivity – Industry 4.0 levers bring value by reducing waiting time or increasing speed of operations. Etalex, warehouse furniture manufacturer introduced robots to increase labor productivity. Company used robots to support workers in physically straining tasks. Human-robot collaboration increased throughput by 40%, without increasing employee base. 
Inventory optimization – Wurth’s iBins uses intelligent cameras to monitor fill level of supply box. The box automatically reorders supply based on accurate fill data. Such real-time supply optimization reduce inventory costs by 20 to 50%.  
Improving quality – Toyota uses advanced process control and data analytics tools for real-time errors tracking and correction. These measures result in minimizing rework and scrap. Applying Industry 4.0 leavers can decrease costs related to suboptimal quality by up to 20%. 
Supply/demand match – In order to maximize the value captured from the market company has to understand customer’s demand. Industry 4.0 gives companies tools to use full value potential. One of OEM in automotive industry uses online configurator to identify the product options customers are willing to pay for. Such solution enabled significant reduction of relevant product options and decreasing time and costs of production.  
Time to market – short time to market gives first-mover advantage. Industry 4.0 leavers can help to speed up development process. Example can be Local Motors. Company produces cars through 3D printing, with design crowd sourced from an online community. Company was able to reduce the development cycle from six years, being industry average, to one year. Additionally, they achieved significant R&D cost reduction. According to McKinsey, possible time to market reduction ranges from 30 to 50 percent. 
Service/aftersales – maintenance and repair are important drivers of service costs. Reduction of these costs for the customer opens potential for additional value creation. Secomea uses remote maintenance to provide service to its customers. Company uses software that allow technicians to establish remote connection to industrial equipment at customers premise and carry out diagnosis. Remote and predictive maintenance can reduce maintenance costs reduction by 10 to even 40 percent. 

## Market trends

Over 50% of industrial assets in factories will be connected
Industry 4.0 is not a theoretical concept, but a real trend affecting how companies operate. An increasing number of manufacturers build industrial data collection solutions.  According to IoT Analytics’ report, by 2020, over 50% of industrial assets will be connected to some kind of data collection system. Percentage of connected assets is going to rise and will be key driver of industrial connectivity market growth.

## Edge-to-cloud connectivity
In last couple years ERP, MES and SCADA systems moved to the cloud. Due to this fact new connectivity architectures, enabling direct edge to cloud connectivity emerged. Traditional communication through SCADA and MES systems depends on OPC servers. Advancements in connectivity technology (connectivity protocols), computing hardware (low cost edge computing that can run applications enabling edge to cloud connectivity) and software (software designed to run on edge devices as small as a Raspberry Pi) enable new architectures where edge devices can establish direct connection with the cloud.

## Edge computing 
Over recent years enterprise computing has been cloud-centric. There are many reasons for that. Cloud solutions are often cheaper, more powerful, easier to implement, maintain and scale. Storing data centrally and off-premise simplifies collaboration, remote working and flexibility. But business needs are changing. Emergence of 5G, increased popularity of IoT resulting in creating large amount of data and real-time analytics makes businesses look for alternative computing solutions. Despite many advantages, latency of makes hosted solutions insufficient for some use cases. 
For time-critical processing users are moving towards edge computing that moves data storage and processing closer to the point it is needed. Placing computing power close to the sensors reduces amount of data sent to the cloud, which simplifies security and decreases network response times. 
Increased popularity of AI and advanced analytics
Advanced analytics and artificial intelligence become more capable. Cloud solutions and improved computing capabilities makes them more accessible. Companies realize that advanced analytics and AI can create significant value when applied to manufacturing industry. Examples include predictive maintenance, digital quality management, and AI-driven demand forecasting. AI plays a key role in the smart factory, helping manufacturers predict demand and allocate resources. 
Wide adoption of digital twins
In simple words, digital twin is a virtual replica of physical object, process, or product that is updated in real-time. Digital twins can range from single piece of equipment to entire production line. Digital twins are combined with IoT sensors providing data like temperature, RPM, pressure and other critical process parameters. Companies can use data to run process simulations, react in real-time to parameter changes to prevent downtimes and optimize production process and supplies stock. 

# Problem statement
## How to have IoT edge but still use benefits of the cloud ?
There are many benefits of running IoT Edge based solution in your factory. Edge computing will keeep you safe. You don´t necessarily need a cloud IoT platform. Industry 4.0 is all about connecting machines, so your manufacturing processes can react more quickly and intelligently to changing factory floor conditions. Connecting assets will help you achieve greater levels of agility and automation, however it will also increase your risks. You don't need to expose all your sensitive data to the cloud to gain the benefits.

Edge computing will also make your big data small. Bringing intelligence to your manufacturing operations means collecting data from sensors in your equipment and analyzing data to make real-time decisions and predictive maintenance. But even in a modest Industry 4.0 project, the amount of data could overwhelm existing and new systems and add a significant cost of bandwidth, data storage, computing and data science.

Additionally edge computing will give you very low latency. Sending data to a remote cloud datacenter for analysis gives long and unpredictable latency. The opportunity to act on the data might be gone for time-sensitive use-cases.

Therefore fog computing is getting more and more traction and sevices like AWS IoT Greengrass are getting more popular. It works quite simple, AWS IoT Greengrass enabled device performs inference locally to make real time decision but also sends data back to the cloud so that it can be used by services like Amazon SageMaker to further improve the model acuracy.
